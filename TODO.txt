* Need to be able to create moving polygons -- how?

* Possible to make the dialog nicer? Draw the background behind it?

* When creating lines, the cursor being outside the grid makes the line
  go in the opposite direction (can't replicate on macpro)
* Create objects which are not obstacles - just decoration
* Multiple selections e.g. highlight several lines for deletion?
* Maybe make pulsation editable?
