* Now dialog is working nicely maybe expand it to get rid of the other dialog code

* It'd be nice to be able to move objects... but define an object...?
    - Maybe all groups of lines should be considered movable? How to group?
    - highlight contiguous lines and press a key to group

* When creating lines, the cursor being outside the grid makes the line
  go in the opposite direction (can't replicate on macpro)
  
* Create objects which are not obstacles - just decoration

* Multiple selections e.g. highlight several lines for deletion?
  - maybe ties in with the TODO of making groups of lines movable?

* Maybe make pulsation editable?
