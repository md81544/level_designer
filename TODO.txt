Note, it's just occurred to me that I've been thinking of this like a path editor
in a vector drawing program. Each line can exist totally independently of each other line
and when it's loaded in Amaze all the lines can form one gameObject regardless of whether
they are connected or not. This simplifies editing greatly.


Add new lines on a blank grid (snapping)

Add rudimentary dialog box functionality

Mouse click will place a line start if no lines exist
ELSE
Mouse click will draw a line from the last line's end to the current point

Mouse click on a vertex will allow it to be dragged, affecting the two connected lines

Mouse click on a line will select it (turn it white) - delete/backspace will then remove that line
and cause the lines either side (if present) to connect somehow

Need to be able to save new levels
