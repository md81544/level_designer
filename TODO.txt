* Need to be able to create moving polygons -- how?
  * Maybe all groups of lines should be considered movable? How to group?

* Possible to make the dialog nicer? Draw the background behind it?

* When creating lines, the cursor being outside the grid makes the line
  go in the opposite direction (can't replicate on macpro)
  
* Create objects which are not obstacles - just decoration

* Multiple selections e.g. highlight several lines for deletion?
  - maybe ties in with the TODO of making groups of lines movable?

* Maybe make pulsation editable?
