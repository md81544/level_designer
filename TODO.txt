* Create regular polygon (in "line" or "moving" mode) -- enough sides would approximate a circle too
  - maybe just press "p", it then asks for number of sides, then you can click once for the centre, and
    drag out the radius. Clicking again would set the shape in place.

* Possible to make the dialog nicer? Draw the background behind it?

* When creating lines, the cursor being outside the grid makes the line
  go in the opposite direction (can't replicate on macpro)
* Create objects which are not obstacles - just decoration
* Multiple selections e.g. highlight several lines for deletion?
* Maybe make pulsation editable?
