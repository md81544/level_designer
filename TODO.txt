Add new lines on a blank grid (snapping)

Add rudimentary dialog box functionality

Mouse click will place a line start if no lines exist
ELSE
Mouse click will draw a line from the last line's end to the current point

Mouse click on a vertex will allow it to be dragged, affecting the two connected lines

Mouse click on a line will select it (turn it white) - delete/backspace will then remove that line
and cause the lines either side (if present) to connect somehow

Need to be able to load existing levels

Need to be able to save new levels



Keys to be supported:
    S - save to default file name (or specified on command line)
    E - insert EXIT object
    B - insert beginning location
    F - insert FUEL object
    * need some way of deleting and inserting lines between others
